<span style="font-size: 99px; color: black; font-family: bubble" class="animated wow bounce infinite"><p class="animated wow bounce">Far away and long long ago in 1995,</p></span><br>
</div>
<div class="verse five">... there lived a new kid in town, Mia, who found herself in an unfamiliar charter school in Beverly Hills. This kid though, was an aspiring fashion designer who wished to turn a profit at the expense of the rich high school elite.
</div>

<div class="verse two even">
One day she approached the clique with the most popular kids in school.

As you might expect, a lifetime of disbelief in the absolute legitimacy of the Seventeen and Teen Vogue magazine agendas, and in the inherent superiority of VH1 video jockey fashion had turned the clique into vapid and humility-challenged tyrants. Mia noticed these traits and decided to use them to her advantage.</div>

<div class="verse three"> 

After scoffing at the perceived inferior fashion choices of Mia upon her arrival at the new school. The head diva, Amber, exclaimed "here's the 4-1-1, Beeotch, you do something special for me or I banish you from all party invites, forever."     

</div>
<div class="verse four even">
Mia replied, <span class="classone">"Word."</span> "Allow me the honor of crafting you a fly wardrobe. I have the freshest fabrics that are so patterned and fluorescent that they can only be seen by certain people -- the type of people you'd want to have in your clique -- the 

<span class="classtwo">dopest,</span><br>
<p class="animated wow rollIn"><span class="classthree"> phattest</span>, </p>
<p class="animated wow rollIn"><span class="class4">most jiggy wit it,</span></p>
<p class="animated wow rollIn"><span class="class5"> All That </span></p>
people, who never listen to Ska or country music."
</div>
<div class="verse five">
After a moment's thought, the head diva agreed to this request. She was flattered by idea that the whole school, existed only to make her and her crew look good (by comparison). It would be like having all that and a bag of chips, DUH!
</div>
<div class="verse six even">

Of course, no such rarefied fabric existed. Years of living outside the bounds of the popular kids had forced
Mia to develop her own moral code that obliged her to swindle and embarrass the clique in the name of
social equality and all misfits. So, as she diligently labored in Home EC, she was able to convince Amber that she was cutting and sewing pieces of fabric that, like, in the strictest objective sense of reality, didn't exist.</div>
<div class="verse one">

When Mia announced that she was finished, Amber looked at her new threadz in the mirror. As she stood there, naked as the day she went to that one pool party and got really wasted, one could see how years of going tanning salons had created grotesque, irreversible sun damage. Amber, of course, saw this too, 
but pretended that she could see the oversized fluorescent croptop, denim mini skirt and platform sandals. To show off her new dank threads, she ordered a runway fashion show to be held at lunch the next day.</div>
<div class ="verse two even">

The following morning, her minions lined the streets for the big parade. Word had spread about Amber's new clothes that only people deserving of popularity could see, and everyone was determined to be more -minded than his or her neighbor.

The parade began with great hoopla. As she tootsie-rolled her red, leathery, carcass down the runway, everyone loudly oohed and ahed at her beautiful new clothes. All except one goth kid (whose parents weren't even really that rich), who shouted:</div>
<div class="verse three">

"Ew, Amber is naked!"
</div>
<div class="verse four even">
The show stopped. Amber paused. A hush fell over the crowd, until the goth shouted:</div>
<div class="verse ten">
<p class="wow animated rollIn">  
<strong>
"NOT!"</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="verse five">
Mia, shook her head, went home that day and asked her parents to transfer her to an arts high school.
</div>
